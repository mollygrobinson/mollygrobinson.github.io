      <description>It’s playoff season, which means teams are hopeful to clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. Since 2014, we’ve seen a four-team playoff for eight years. In the past seven, we’ve seen a lot of the same teams, like Alabama, Clemson, and Ohio State, and occasionally Oklahoma and Notre Dame. However, this year looks slightly different.

      <description>Nick Saban’s dynasty as Alabama head coach includes over 170 wins, 100 plus draft pics, three Heisman winners and eight National Championship appearances, six of which resulted in National Titles.
